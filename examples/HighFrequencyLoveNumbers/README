The files and Jupyter notebook provided here are the software and data used to create all figures in the manuscript "The high-frequency tidal response of ocean worlds: Application to Europa and Ganymede". 

The data files containing the static Love numbers that are required to run this notebook can be downloaded from the Zenodo repository https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6330195, and should be placed in the "data" directory.
 
The Jupyter notebook uses the programming language Julia, and specficially was tested using v1.6.5, available here: https://julialang.org/downloads/

After installing this version of Julia, the following dependencies are required to run the notebook:

IJulia
PyCall
PyPlot 
Interpolations
HDF5
Conda 

These can all be installed from the Julia terminal by typing "]" to enter the Julia package manager, followed by "add IJulia", for example.

We also need the python seaborn package. In the Julia terminal, run

    using Conda
    Conda.add("seaborn")

Once these dependencies are installed, open a Julia terminal and run

    using Julia
    notebook()

This will open an IJulia Jupyter notebook in your browser. Navigate to the file "high_freq_lovenum.ipynb", and you will be able to reproduce all figures from our paper by running the notebook.
