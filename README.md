# global-ocean-tides

global-ocean-tides contains a small Julia module to solve the Laplace Tidal Equations (LTE); the set of fluid equations definining the response of a thin layer of fluid subject to tidal forces.

The package solves the algebraic set of equations that define the LTE with linear drag, and is able to calculate the dynamical Love number of any body with a global, subsurface fluid layer, given a set of static Love numbers.
